# In-Between-Frame-Generation

Traditional 2D animation remains a largely manual process, where most of the frames in an animated sequence are hand-drawn. An average 23-minute animated TV episode
will contain between 3,000 and 10,000 distinct hand-crafted drawings. The pipeline to produce these drawings is usually divided into two stages:

1.  drawing the key frames, which serve as the landmarks for a shot (usually the beginning, middle, and end of motion)
2.  drawing the in-between frames, which serve as intermediate frames that fill in the blanks from key frame to key frame.

Professional animators often describe the latter process, a.k.a., in-betweening, as repetitive, monotonous, and creatively uninspiring work that is frequently relegated to inexperienced animators or outsourced to overseas production houses. While the process of in-betweening has been largely automatized for other types of animation, such as 3D animation, there is not currently a robust solution to facilitate this process for traditional 2D animation
